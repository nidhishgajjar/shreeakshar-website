              <p className="mb-8">
              Akshar was started in 1960. Akshar is a 3rd generation print film previously known as Akshar Graphics. Driven by customer’s demand for high quality output, Akshar NX switched from analog flexo platemaking to digital with the installation of a KODAK FLEXCEL NX System. We have also achieved Kodak’s rigorous FLEXCEL NX certification to match our quality with global quality and standards defined by Kodak.
